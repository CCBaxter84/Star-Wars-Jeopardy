This is a modified version of Jeopardy! All clues and categories are based on Star Wars lore. This game is meant for two players to play against each other. Additionally, rather than buzz in first, the players take turns. The game is only one round. There is one daily double clue randomly located on the game board.

I coded this app in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
